Assess whether validation criteria and parameters on input data match business
rules and enforce rejection of unmatched input types. In case of online processing
systems, verify that invalid data is rejected or edited on entry and test the logic checks/calculation checks performed. Database operatives (such as *, =, or, select) should be disallowed as valid input, as they can be used to disrupt or retrieve information from the database.

Inquire managers about whether validation criteria and parameters on input data are periodically reviewed, confirmed and updated in a timely, appropriate and authorised manner. Assurance could be obtained through documentation review, code analysis or interviews.

Inquire and check documentation in order to verify the possibility of overriding input data control validations and controls. Verify if the override actions are being
properly logged and reviewed for appropriateness. Check whether authority to override is restricted to only supervisory staff and to a limited number of situations. Inspect error corrections, entry overrides and other documents to verify that the procedures are followed.
